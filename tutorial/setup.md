## Quick start

# Startup Guide

## Downloads
To start, please download the newest release of Source Hangout (avalible in the discord server)
And [playit.gg](https://playit.gg/download) if you do not want to port forward your router (not shown here)


Once you have those, we can start.
Navigate to your malmetro folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\sourcemods\MalMetro`
Create a folder in there named start.bat with the following code:
https://pastes.driver.fyi/ZClfptFuSl (may change so double check your filenames!)
Now, open playit, and follow the steps to setup a UDP port for 27015.
Copy the IP and connect via the console. 
~ to open it, then type connect *your playit.gg ip with the port, etc: name.playit.gg:28394*
Make sure your server is runing, and also double check your firewall.


That's all. You (should) have your server up and running! If you want more info, I am willing to help you with any questions. And if you have any support you need with setting up a server, head to the discord to get said support.
