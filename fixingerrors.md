# Fixing Errors



## Common Error #1:
Directories do not match


## How to fix:

Navigate to your sourcemods folder 
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods`

Look for the Source Hangout folder, it won't allow you to join if it is named anything besides `Source-Hangout`
Common names of the mod if you have tons installed: `Malmetro` `Source (space) Hangout` `SourceHangout`

if you have any of these rename the folder to `Source-Hangout` and restart steam. It should then allow you to join.
